    <h5>#1</h5>
    <p>A: Marks are points.</p>
    <p>B: Data Type<br>
      - Population (Thousands) is quantitative.<br>
      - City (Edinburgh, Stockholm, Florence, etc.) is nominal.
    </p>
    <p>C: Visual Channels<br>
      - Population (Thousands) is varying in horizontal position on an unaligned scale.<br>
      - City (Edinburgh, Stockholm, Florence, etc.) is varying in vertical position on an aligned scale.
    </p>
    <p>
      D: Scale Break<br>
      The scale break is effective because since there is a large gap in the data points - with Naples, Paris, Constantinople, and London having significantly higher values than the other cities, 
      the scale break allows the data points for these 4 cities to still be kept within the chart without distorting the appearance or spacing in the other data points. 
    </p>
    <p>
      E: Data Type<br>
      - Domain area (Biotech, ICT, Humanities, etc.) is nominal.<br>
      - Social impact is ordinal.<br>
      - Capital investment is quantitative.
    </p>
    <p>F: Visual Channels<br>
      - Domain area (Biotech, ICT, Humanities, etc.) is varying in color hue.<br>
      - Social impact is varying in vertical position on an aligned scale.<br>
      - Capital investment is varying in volume.
    </p>
    <p>
      G: 3D Bubble Chart Visualization<br><br>
      This visualization can be ineffective because the numerous axes and dimensions can make it more difficult to determine the coordinates of a specific data point and thus negatively impact the accuracy of the data. 
      For instance, it is hard to tell what the exact radii are for the domains ranked 5 through 9 due to their volumes appearing to be similar, as well as what the exact height of the domain ranked 2 since it does not appear to "hover in space" the way the other domains are.

    <h5>#4</h5>
    <p>
      A: The type of visualization is parallel coordinates.
    </p>
    <p>
      B: Each of the horizontal red and blue lines represents a data entry (in this case, a car in the database) plotted against 7 attributes which are represented by the 7 axes.
    </p>
    <p>
      C: Advantage & Drawback<br>
      - Advantage: Since each data entry is represented by a line connecting the axes, it is easy to understand the relationship between the variables (axes) by observing the pattern/trend in the collection of lines. <br>
      - Drawback: If there are a lot of data points, especially ones sharing common values, the visual can become over-cluttered with overlaying lines, making it illegible and difficult to distinguish the lines (each entry) from each other.
